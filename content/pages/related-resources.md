This paper describes the pedagogy and outcomes from an earlier version of this class.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Animations

Writing Web Links
-----------------

The following links are helpful places to do further investigation into good writing:

Swan, Judith A., and George D. Gopen. "The Science of Scientific Writing." _American Scientist_ 78 (November-December 1990): 550-558. ([PDF](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~swanson/papers/science-of-writing.pdf)) - A very useful article that analyzes the structure and style of scientific writing.

Writing Up Research - A fairly comprehensive explanation of the components of the research article from the Asian Institute of Technology.

Writing in the Neurobiological Sciences - A scientific writing course from the University of Florida with many useful links.

[Writing Guidelines for Engineering and Science Students](http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/) - A useful resource on scientific writing from Penn State. Includes many examples and additional links.

[Instructions to Authors in the Health Sciences](http://mulford.utoledo.edu/instr/) - This site provides links to instructions to authors for over 3,500 journals in the health and life sciences.
